## 0. Requirements

**This is part of a two-tutorial series on System Administration: I recommend to first finish [Atet's 15 Minute Tutorial on Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/atet/learn/blob/master/raspberrypi/README.md#atet--learn--raspberrypi) to put this content in better context**

### Software

* Windows: This tutorial was developed on Microsoft Windows 10 with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
* MacOS: [Your Terminal program is Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS))
* Linux: I recommend Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

### Computer Hardware

* This tutorial uses the $10 Raspberry Pi Zero W ("wireless")
* You will also need a 5V micro USB cell phone charger and â‰¥8 GB microSD card

### WiFi Network

**The Raspberry Pi Zero W has specific WiFi requirements:**

* 2.4 GHz b/g/n WiFi-only
* Connect to WiFi using only the network name (a.k.a. SSID) and password
* Disabled ["wireless isolation" (a.k.a. AP isolation, station isolation, or client isolation)](https://www.howtogeek.com/179089/lock-down-your-wi-fi-network-with-your-routers-wireless-isolation-option/)

**Once you have everything here, you're ready to go!**

## 3. Nextcloud Server Installation

### 3.1. Installing dependencies

#### 3.1.1. MariaDB database 

* Download and install MariaDB

```
$ sudo apt-get -y install mariadb-server-10.3 && \
  sudo /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation
```

* Enter the following in the `mysql_secure_installation`:
   * Enter current password for root, just press Enter
   * Set root password: type "`y`"
   * Enter "`nextcloud`" as the password for now (password is invisible for security)
   * Answer the remainder of questions with "`y`"

[![.img/step03a.png](.img/step03a.png)](#nolink)

* Create a new database for Nextcloud in MariaDB
* Enter the password you made earlier
* Once you execute "`sudo mysql -u root -p`", you will start the terminal for MariaDB, enter each line after "`>`" one at a time until you exit MariaDB:

```
$ sudo mysql -u root -p
> create database nextcloud;
> create user ncuser;
> set password for ncuser = password("password");
> grant all PRIVILEGES on nextcloud.* to ncuser@localhost identified by 'password';
> exit;
```

#### 3.1.2. Apache web server and PHP tools

```
$ sudo apt-get -y install apache2 \
  php php-gd php-curl php-zip php-xml \
  php-mbstring libapache2-mod-php \
  python-mysqldb php-mysql && \
  sudo service apache2 restart
```

### 3.2. Nextcloud server

* Download and extract the latest version of Nextcloud (v17.0.2 as of Jan. 1, 2020)

```
$ cd /var/www/html && \
  sudo wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/nextcloud-17.0.2.tar.bz2 && \
  sudo tar -xvjf nextcloud-17.0.2.tar.bz2
```

### 3.3. Permissions

```
$ sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/nextcloud/data && \
  sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/nextcloud/data && \
  sudo chmod 750 /var/www/html/nextcloud/data && \
  cd /var/www/html/nextcloud && \
  sudo chown www-data:www-data config apps && \
  sudo service apache2 restart && \
  sudo service apache2 status
```

* The "`apache2`" service must be "`active (running)`"
* You can quit this screen by pressing "`q`"

[![.img/step03b.png](.img/step03b.png)](#nolink)

**You are now done with accessing the Pi through command line, the remaining steps will be on your local computer**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Nextcloud Server Setup

* In your web browser, navigate to "`http://<PI'S IP ADDRESS>/nextcloud`"
* Choose a username and password for the administrator account and remember it for the Client Setup step 6
* The default Data Folder path should be correct: "`/var/www/html/nextcloud/data`"
* Scroll down to continue setup
* Fill out the MariaDB database information from earlier:
   * Database User: "`ncuser`"
   * Database password: "`password`"
   * Database name: "`nextcloud`"
   * localhost: Keep as "`localhost`"
* Press "Finish setup"

[![.img/step04a.png](.img/step04a.png)](#nolink)

* Setup processing will take 5-10 minutes
* Once completed, you will be presented with a brief overview of Nextcloud (click right arrow to view or click the X to exit)

[![.img/step04b.png](.img/step04b.png)](#nolink)

* Briefly explore the web-based interface to manage Nextcloud
* Notice that you can upload and manage files through the web-based graphical user interface (GUI)
* **Log out without changing any settings at this time**

* Continue with all the default settings during the installation
* Once completed, choose to "Run Nextcloud" 

[![.img/step05a.png](.img/step05a.png)](#nolink)

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Nextcloud Client Setup

* Once the Nextcloud application starts, select "Login"
* Log into your Nextcloud Pi server with: "`http://<PI'S IP ADDRESS>/nextcloud/`"
   * You must use "`http://`" and "`/nextcloud/`"

[![.img/step06a.png](.img/step06a.png)](#nolink)

* Nextcloud will now attempt to authenticate with your Pi by web browser
* Your web browser should pop up with the login page for your Nextcloud server
* Input the administrative username and password you chose in step 4 and login
* Choose to "Grant access"

[![.img/step06b.png](.img/step06b.png)](#nolink)

* Once your client has successfully authenticated, a final setup window will appear with two important options (just leave default for now):
   * Sync everything or selective sync
   * Location of local synced directory
* Nextcloud server will now sync with your local directory

[![.img/step06c.png](.img/step06c.png)](#nolink)

* Once syncing is complete, you can use your Nextcloud directory in File Explorer just like any other normal directory (move files into/out of, delete files, etc.)
* This directory will be seamlessly synced with your Nextcloud server

[![.img/step06d.png](.img/step06d.png)](#nolink)

### Cleanup

* You can uninstall the Nextcloud Client just like any other program in Windows
* For the Pi server, I would recommend formatting the entire SD card if you want to start over or try another project

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Epilogue

**As a web-based file sharing service, Nextcloud is flexible enough to fit most needs:**

* **Web-based graphical user interface** (GUI): Even if you don't integrate Nextcloud into Windows, you can use the web GUI to upload and manage files
* **Windows integration**: Nextcloud will work quietly in the background to actively sync and backup your files

**For long term solutions, consider the following:**

* **Better hardware**: Raspberry Pi Zero W will be sluggish
* **Reliable storage**: Flash memory (e.g. micro SD card) is not as reliable as traditional disk drives
* **Faster connection**: Zero W's WiFi bandwidth is slow compared to wired ethernet
* **Security**: Never expose a computer to the internet without taking precautions: https://www.upguard.com/blog/10-essential-steps-for-configuring-a-new-server

**Pro-tips:**

* **Backup and redundancy**: You can mirror your files on multiple devices by connecting to a common account
* **Global access**: You can access your files anywhere in the world

## 8. Next Steps

**We touched on a bunch of different IT tasks here; you're easily on your way to becoming a self-sufficient ["techie"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/techie), it just takes a lot of experimenting and completing projects like this**

* Try this tutorial one more time to solidify these concepts
* **If you would like to learn more about Bash and command line interface (CLI), please see [Atet's 15 Minute Introduction to Regular Expressions (in Bash)](https://github.com/atet/learn/blob/master/regex/README.md#atet--learn--regex)**
* Now that you already have a Raspberry Pi, try some other fun projects: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/
* Trying to go back to sleep at 3AM? Read the official Raspberry Pi starter guide: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi

## Need More Power?

* The Raspberry Pi Zero is amazing for its price point, [but it was pretty slow handling Nextcloud](https://www.reddit.com/r/NextCloud/comments/6shc9a/can_i_run_nextcloud_on_a_pi_zero/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x); this brand has other more powerful and more expensive computers if you need the horsepower

## Troubleshooting

Issue | Solution
--- | ---
Is Nextcloud supported on ARMv6 (e.g. Raspberry Pi Zero W)? | Yes, https://help.nextcloud.com/t/raspberry-pi-zero-w-unsupported/44910/6
Nextcloud web GUI seems to be hanging/frozen | Just wait, the Raspberry Pi Zero is not a supercomputer
Nextcloud client cannot authenticate with the Pi server | Make sure you are using "`http://`" in the address and NOT "`https://`", also you need to add the "`/nextcloud/`" in the address
