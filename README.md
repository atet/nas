# Introduction to Network Attached Storage (INCOMPLETE)

**Estimated time to completion: 15 minutes**<br>(excluding waiting times for downloads and updates)

* This introduction to Network Attached Storage (NAS) only covers what's absolutely necessary to get you up and running
* You are here because **you want to setup a simple but powerful shared NAS**
* We will be using the [free and open source Nextcloud service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nextcloud) on the $10 Raspberry Pi Zero W

## 0. Requirements

**This is part of a two-tutorial series on System Administration: I recommend to first finish [Atet's 15 Minute Tutorial on Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/atet/learn/blob/master/raspberrypi/README.md#atet--learn--raspberrypi) to put this content in better context**

### Software

* Windows: This tutorial was developed on Microsoft Windows 10 with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
* MacOS: [Your Terminal program is Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS))
* Linux: I recommend Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

### Computer Hardware

* This tutorial uses the $10 Raspberry Pi Zero W ("wireless")
* You will also need a 5V micro USB cell phone charger and â‰¥8 GB microSD card

### WiFi Network

**The Raspberry Pi Zero W has specific WiFi requirements:**

* 2.4 GHz b/g/n WiFi-only
* Connect to WiFi using only the network name (a.k.a. SSID) and password
* Disabled ["wireless isolation" (a.k.a. AP isolation, station isolation, or client isolation)](https://www.howtogeek.com/179089/lock-down-your-wi-fi-network-with-your-routers-wireless-isolation-option/)

**Once you have everything here, you're ready to go!**

## 1. Game Plan

[![.img/step01a.png](.img/step01a.png)](#nolink)

* Regardless of your personal data maintenance regime (backup, sharing, etc.), this tutorial is meant to reinforce IT and system administration (SysAdmin) tasks
* Hopefully, setting up the network attached storage (NAS) service in this tutorial is useful enough for you to incorporate into your personal routine

[![.img/step01b.png](.img/step01b.png)](#nolink)

* This tutorial will setup your Raspberry Pi Zero W as a file server that will be accessible to anyone on your home network
* This will not interfere with existing NAS on your network

## 3. Nextcloud Server Installation

### 3.1. Installing dependencies

#### 3.1.1. MariaDB database 

* Download and install MariaDB

```
$ sudo apt-get -y install mariadb-server-10.3 && \
  sudo /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation
```

* Enter the following in the `mysql_secure_installation`:
   * Enter current password for root, just press Enter
   * Set root password: type "`y`"
   * Enter "`nextcloud`" as the password for now (password is invisible for security)
   * Answer the remainder of questions with "`y`"

[![.img/step03a.png](.img/step03a.png)](#nolink)

* Create a new database for Nextcloud

```
$ sudo mysql -u root -p
> create database nextcloud;
> create user ncuser;
> set password for ncuser = password("password");
> grant all PRIVILEGES on nextcloud.* to ncuser@localhost identified by 'raindrop';
> exit;
```

#### 3.1.2. Apache web server

```
$ sudo apt-get -y install apache2
```

#### 3.1.3. PHP tools

```
$ sudo apt-get -y install php php-gd \
  php-curl php-zip php-xml php-mbstring \
  libapache2-mod-php python-mysqldb php-mysql && \
  sudo service apache2 restart
```

### 3.2. Nextcloud server

* Download and extract the latest version of Nextcloud (v17.0.2 as of Jan. 1, 2020)

```
$ cd /var/www/html && \
  sudo wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/nextcloud-17.0.2.tar.bz2 && \
  sudo tar -xvjf nextcloud-17.0.2.tar.bz2
```

### 3.3. Permissions

```
$ sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/nextcloud/data && \
  sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/nextcloud/data && \
  sudo chmod 750 /var/www/html/nextcloud/data && \
  cd /var/www/html/nextcloud && \
  sudo chown www-data:www-data config apps && \
  sudo service apache2 restart && \
  sudo service apache2 status
```

* The "`apache2`" service must be "`active (running)`"
* You can quit this screen by pressing "`q`"

## 4. Nextcloud Server Setup

* In your web browser, navigate to "`http://<PI'S IP ADDRESS>/nextcloud`"
* Choose a username and password for the administrator account
* The Data Folder default should be correct: "`/var/www/html/nextcloud/data`"
* Scroll down to continue setup
* Fill out the databse information from earlier:
   * Database User: "`ncuser`"
   * Database password: "`password`"
   * Database name: "`nextcloud`"
   * localhost: Keep as "`localhost`"
* Press "Finish setup"
   * This will take a few minutes to setup

[![.img/step04a.png](.img/step04a.png)](#nolink)

* Once the setup is completed, you will be presented with a brief overview of Nextcloud (click right arrow to view or click the X to exit)

[![.img/step04b.png](.img/step04b.png)](#nolink)

* Briefly explore the web-based interface to manage Nextcloud
* There are some example pictures, documents, and videos included with this install
* Do not change any settings right now

## 7. Next Steps

**We touched on a bunch of different IT tasks here; you're easily on your way to becoming a self-sufficient ["techie"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/techie), it just takes a lot of experimenting and completing projects like this**

* Try this tutorial one more time to solidify these concepts
* **If you would like to learn more about Bash and command line interface (CLI), please see [Atet's 15 Minute Introduction to Regular Expressions (in Bash)](https://github.com/atet/learn/blob/master/regex/README.md#atet--learn--regex)**
* Now that you already have a Raspberry Pi, try some other fun projects: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/
* Trying to go back to sleep at 3AM? Read the official Raspberry Pi starter guide: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi

## Need More Power?

* The Raspberry Pi Zero is amazing for its price point, [but it was pretty slow handling Nextcloud](https://www.reddit.com/r/NextCloud/comments/6shc9a/can_i_run_nextcloud_on_a_pi_zero/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x); this brand has other more powerful and more expensive computers if you need the horsepower
* For a NAS that's used by many people concurrently; you will need more RAM, disk storage, and CPU power (multi-core)
* You might even consider having the NAS hard-wired to your network via faster gigabit ethernet instead of the Pi Zero W's slower WiFi
