# Introduction to Network Attached Storage

**Estimated time to completion: 15 minutes**<br>(excluding waiting times for downloads and updates)

* This introduction to Network Attached Storage (NAS) only covers what's absolutely necessary to get you up and running
* You are here because **you want to setup a simple but powerful shared NAS**
* We will be using the [free and open source Nextcloud service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nextcloud) on the $10 Raspberry Pi Zero W

## 0. Requirements

**This is part of a two-tutorial series on System Administration: I recommend to first finish [Atet's 15 Minute Tutorial on Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/atet/learn/blob/master/raspberrypi/README.md#atet--learn--raspberrypi) to put this content in better context**

### Software

* Windows: This tutorial was developed on Microsoft Windows 10 with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
* MacOS: [Your Terminal program is Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS))
* Linux: I recommend Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

### Computer Hardware

* This tutorial uses the $10 Raspberry Pi Zero W ("wireless")
* You will also need a 5V micro USB cell phone charger and ≥8 GB microSD card

### WiFi Network

**The Raspberry Pi Zero W has specific WiFi requirements:**

* 2.4 GHz b/g/n WiFi-only
* Connect to WiFi using only the network name (a.k.a. SSID) and password
* Disabled ["wireless isolation" (a.k.a. AP isolation, station isolation, or client isolation)](https://www.howtogeek.com/179089/lock-down-your-wi-fi-network-with-your-routers-wireless-isolation-option/)

**Once you have everything here, you're ready to go!**

## 7. Next Steps

**We touched on a bunch of different IT tasks here; you're easily on your way to becoming a self-sufficient ["techie"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/techie), it just takes a lot of experimenting and completing projects like this**

* Try this tutorial one more time to solidify these concepts
* Now that you already have a Raspberry Pi, try some other fun projects: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/
* Trying to go back to sleep at 3AM? Read the official Raspberry Pi starter guide: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi

**If you would like to learn more about Bash and command line interface (CLI), please see [Atet's 15 Minute Introduction to Regular Expressions (in Bash)](https://github.com/atet/learn/blob/master/regex/README.md#atet--learn--regex)**

## Why Raspberry Pi?

* **_Trust me on this one_**: There's a huge difference in your learning experience when the brand you're working with has sold 10+ million computers vs. lesser-known alternatives that may be a _bit_ cheaper
* With a larger userbase, there's reliable community and official support, bugs get fixed quicker, you can expect timely updates, etc.
* The Raspberry Pi Zero is amazing for its price point, [but it's not going to play Crysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crysis_(video_game)#Legacy); this brand has other more powerful and more expensive computers if you need the horsepower
